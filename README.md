# N423

This is the repository for my DATABASE DEV FOR MOBILE APPS (N423) course.

As the semester progresses, different lectures (week01, week02, etc.) and homework assignments (hw01, hw02, etc.) will appear in the repo.

Each folder will have:
* A project and/or project files
* A README with links to a live build of the project
* Any assets the project used
